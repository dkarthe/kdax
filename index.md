I build software for the [ODI](http://theodi.org/team/sam-pikesley) and play music with [The Raw Funk Maharishi](http://rawfunkmaharishi.uk), and I have a [non-working pancreas](http://www.diabetes.org.uk/Guide-to-diabetes/What-is-diabetes/What-is-Type-1-diabetes/).

Some other places you can find me on the internets:

* My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pikesley) stream (and the [horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/pikesley_ebooks) Markov chain version)
* Some [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCix1XW329gv "The story of the Arsebees") [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt_J0jNqtZg "Vandalising your Github commit history") have [given](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyg5tzi-H4s&feature=youtu.be&t=34m40s "My shed has an API")
* My [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/) page

* My [ello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) listing
* My [CV](cv)

In fact, if you come across a user called _pikesley_ on any service, it's probably me
