excerpt: "We can approximate pi using nothing more than random numbers and some simple
  geometry: in essence, we randomly throw darts at a square board of side r; within
  the square we inscribe a quadrant of a circle of radius r with its centre at (0,
  0). We count all of the 'throws'; if a dart lands within the quadrant, we also count
  a 'hit'.\r\n\r\nFor a large number of throws, we see that:\r\n<pre>\r\n        hits
  \   area_of_quadrant\r\n       ------ = ----------------\r\n       throws    area_of_square\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSome
  half-remembered geometry tells us that:\r\n<pre>\r\n       area_of_quadrant   (1
  / 4) * pi * r^2   pi\r\n       ---------------- = ------------------ = --\r\n        area_of_square
  \          r^2            4\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n<pre>     \r\n                area_of_quadrant

<p>We can approximate pi using nothing more than random numbers and some simple geometry: in essence, we randomly throw darts at a square board of side r; within the square we inscribe a quadrant of a circle of radius r with its centre at (0, 0). We count all of the 'throws'; if a dart lands within the quadrant, we also count a 'hit'.</p>
<p>For a large number of throws, we see that:</p>
<pre>
        hits    area_of_quadrant
       ------ = ----------------
       throws    area_of_square
</pre>
<p>Some half-remembered geometry tells us that:</p>
<pre>
       area_of_quadrant   (1 / 4) * pi * r^2   pi
       ---------------- = ------------------ = --
        area_of_square           r^2            4
</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>     
                area_of_quadrant        hits
       pi = 4 * ---------------- = 4 * ------
                 area_of_square        throws
</pre>

I first solved this problem as an undergraduate sometime in 1994 as part of a Computational Physics module. Using FORTRAN.</p>
