profile:  |
  Working closely with AMEE's relatively small team of Java and Ruby devs, I was responsible for:

  * Putting in a huge amount of Chef plumbing (running off of [AMEE's own Chef
    server](http://www.amee.com/blog/2012/02/22/building-a-chef-server-from-scratch/)) -
    AMEE's config management previously consisted of a handful of bash scripts
  * Deploying and configuring Splunk
  * Migrating several of AMEE's legacy apps from leased iron in a DC to AWS

  alongside the usual SysAdmin work of backup-and-restore, capacity planning, etc.
