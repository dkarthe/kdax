  My role at VisualDNA was pretty much DevOps before I knew that DevOps was even a thing
  – as a busy start-up with diverse client projects there were often multiple
  deploys per day, meaning I had to work very closely with the developers to
  make sure we were all on the same page.

  This close working relationship was particularly fruitful during the gradual
  transfer of many of VisualDNA’s core services from the legacy platform (a
  couple of racks of Linux boxes in a London datacentre) to Amazon Web Services.
  The back-and-forth between myself and the development team was invaluable as
  we iterated through various combinations of EC2 Instance Types to find the
  setup that best fitted our requirements.

  The transfer to AWS accelerated rapidly during 2011; the setup I left them with included:

  * A 16-node Cassandra cluster
  * A 6-node Hadoop cluster
  * Several groups of Elastic-Load-Balanced web servers

  This platform is still in production use, including an all-new Quiz Engine
  which as far as I know is still performing extremely well.

  During my time at VisualDNA I also:

  * Completely rewrote the legacy deployment system (in Python), and subsequently
    repurposed a lot of this code to handle AWS deploy
  * Introduced the MMM multi-master replication manager for MySQL on the
    front-end database servers
  * Cleaned-up and reorganised the Subversion repositories (the better to
    integrate with my new deploy system)
  * Managed a migration from Akamai EdgeControl to Amazon Cloudfront
  * Substantially rewrote the ‘event-tracking and processing’ system
  * Managed a migration from hosted Exchange email to Google Mail
