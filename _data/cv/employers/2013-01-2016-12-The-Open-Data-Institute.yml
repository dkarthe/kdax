  My role at the ODI has encompassed many things - initially, leading on the building and maintenance of all of the [test-driven Chef infrastructure](https://github.com/theodi/chef-skellington) for the ODI's first round of core tools, primarily [Open Data Certificates](http://toolbox.theodi.org/tools/certificates/) and [CSV Lint](http://toolbox.theodi.org/tools/csvlint/), and our [adoption of GDS's CMS suite](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5181-adventures-in-early-adoption-of-open-source-code).

  Subsequent highlights include:

    * Gaining a comprehensive grasp of HTTP and REST (mainly from working under the guidance of [Jeni Tennison](https://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison))
    * Learning to love TDD, primarily through heavy exposure to RSpec and Cucumber
    * Embracing the Github -> Travis -> Heroku continuous deployment chain
    * Building front-end apps (e.g. the TfL [Train Data Demonstrator](http://goingunderground.herokuapp.com/)) and so getting a handle on Bootstrap, JavaScript, Sass and D3
    * Providing technical mentoring for one of our PhD students from the [WDAqua](http://wdaqua.eu/) programme
    * Occasional speaking engagements, primarily on the subject of Working In The Open

  *Everything* we ever built at the ODI has been built in the open and all of our code is [up on Github](https://github.com/theodi).
