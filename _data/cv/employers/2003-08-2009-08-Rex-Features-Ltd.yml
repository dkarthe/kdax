  My work at Rex covered the usual gamut of Sysadmin tasks, including: backup
  and recovery, webserver administration, DNS management, plenty of scripting
  (mostly in bash), patching servers, and writing and maintaining documentation.
  There was also some SQL Server admin, and a certain amount of desktop support –
  Rex is a company of ~80 employees, supported by an IT department of four.
  All new server hardware passed through my hands for installation and configuration.

  When I joined Rex, the IT department consisted of two very busy people. The
  IT infrastructure had been growing rapidly, deployment had happened on a
  seemingly ad-hoc basis, and documentation was fairly sparse. My initial tasks included:

  * Installing a CVS server (yes, this was 2003) and gathering code and scripts into it
  * Rolling out the Amanda backup system and setting up a proper backup and recovery scheme
  * Getting the RT ticketing system up and running (we later moved to Jira)
  * Beginning the process of documenting everything in Twiki (we subsequently migrated to Mediawiki)

  Subsequently, I was directly involved in:

  * Setting up the Nagios network monitoring system
  * Migrating the internal mail from Novell to Exchange, and later outsourcing
    this function to Cobweb’s hosted Exchange platform
  * Configuring VPNs between Rex’s headquarters and various locations – initially
    using isakmpd on OpenBSD, and latterly on a Watchguard Firebox
  * Overseeing the transfer of Rex’s image data – 5 terabytes of jpegs at the
    time of writing – from a cluster based on a number of FreeBSD servers to a
    set of Network Appliance 3050 filers
  * Configuring and deploying Alteon load-balancers for the Rex website, which
    gets ~1.5 million hits and shifts ~13 gigs of data a day
  * Migrating Rex’s code from CVS to Subversion
  * Specifying and documenting a “standard Rex server install” – except for a
    handful of Windows servers, the whole of Rex’s server room and colo are
    running FreeBSD, so the standard install is a set of common ports and a
    number of scripts

  Rex went on to acquire another picture agency in Los Angeles, which brought
  about a project to integrate their image archive into Rex’s, modifying the
  server software to enable them to use the Rex client application, and
  deploying a new set of servers to support of all of this. The final setup
  consisted of a redundant pair of Microsoft SQL servers, a set of NetApp
  filers and shelves, and a group of FreeBSD servers (running apache and mod_perl)
  serving up three websites and a range of internal webservices, all sitting
  behind a pair of Alteon load-balancers.
