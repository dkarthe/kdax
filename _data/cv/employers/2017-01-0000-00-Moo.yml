  I joined Moo at the beginning of a massive project to migrate from hosted tin to AWS. This involved jumping in at the deep-end with Terraform and Ansible, and was pretty much all I worked on until July 2017, when we pulled the trigger on a remarkably smooth cut-over.

  The rest of the summer was spent on cleaning-up some things we'd kicked down the road during the migration project, and since September I've been on a project to build a Kubernetes-based self-service platform.
